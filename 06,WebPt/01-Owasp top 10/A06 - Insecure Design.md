Insecure Design is about flaws in the architecture and business logic — problems that cannot be fixed by perfect code implementation because the design itself is fundamentally flawed.

**Meaning:** The application’s *design/logic* is insecure, so attackers can abuse it even if there is no technical bug.  

 “Insecure design is when security controls are missing at design level, like no rate limit, weak reset flow, or broken business logic.”
