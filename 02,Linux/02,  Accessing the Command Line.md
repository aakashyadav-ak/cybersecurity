#  Command Line
The command line (also called terminal, console, or shell) is a text-based interface to interact with the Linux operating system. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands.

- Faster than GUI for repetitive tasks
- Can be scripted and automated
- Works over remote connections (SSH)
- Many security tools are CLI-only
- Less resource intensive
- Available on all Linux systems including servers


## Accessing the Command Line

### 1. Physical Console
- Direct keyboard and monitor connection
- Used for server rooms and local access
- Login prompt appears after boot

### 2. Virtual Consoles (TTY)
- RHEL provides multiple virtual consoles
- Switch between them using keyboard shortcuts
- Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6 for text consoles
- Ctrl + Alt + F1 or F2 usually returns to GUI (if installed)

**TTY originally means Teletypewriter (old physical terminals).**

**TTY usually refers to:**
- physical console
- virtual console like Ctrl+Alt+F1

**Examples:**
- /dev/tty1
- /dev/tty2
### 3. Terminal Emulator (GUI)
- Application within desktop environment
- GNOME Terminal is default in RHEL
- Access via Applications menu or right-click desktop


**PTY (Pseudo Terminal)**
Used when you open terminals inside GUI or SSH sessions.

**Examples:**
/dev/pts/0
/dev/pts/1
### 4. Remote Access (SSH)
- Secure Shell protocol
- Access from another machine over network
- Most common method for servers
- Command: ssh username@hostname


#### After login, you see the shell prompt:
```
[user@hostname ~]$
```

| Part       | Meaning                            |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `user`     | Current username                   |
| `@`        | Separator                          |
| `hostname` | System name                        |
| `~`        | Current directory (`~` means home) |
| `$`        | Regular user prompt                |
| `#`        | **Root** user prompt               |

```
[john@server1 ~]$        # Regular user john in home directory
[root@server1 /etc]#     # Root user in /etc directory
[admin@webserver logs]$  # User admin in logs directory
```

#  Execute Commands with the Bash Shell
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the default shell in RHEL. 
- Interprets and executes commands
- Provides scripting capabilities
- Maintains command history
- Supports tab completion
- Allows command chaining and redirection

### Running Multiple Commands
#### Sequential Execution (;)

Run commands one after another regardless of success:
```
cd /tmp; ls; pwd
```

#### Conditional AND (&&)

Run next command only if previous succeeds:
```
