### What is Active Directory?
Active Directory (AD) = Microsoft's centralized database for managing users, computers, and resources in a Windows network

**Active Directory is a Microsoft system used to manage:**
- users
- computers
- groups
- passwords
- policies
inside an organization network.

**Without AD (Small network):**
```
Each computer has its own user accounts
    ↓
User needs account on EVERY computer
    ↓
Passwords stored locally on each machine
    ↓
Nightmare to manage!
```

**With AD (Enterprise network):**
```
Central database of all users
    ↓
One account works everywhere
    ↓
Single sign-on (SSO)
    ↓
Easy centralized management
```
