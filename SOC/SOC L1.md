____
 MUST MEMORIZE (Non-Negotiable)

These are rapid-fire interview questions.

🔹 Frameworks (Section 2)

Memorize:

==**MITRE ATT&CK definition (Tactic vs Technique)**==

These mappings:

==**Brute Force → T1110**==

==**Phishing → T1566**==

==**PowerShell → T1059.001**==

==**Credential Dumping → T1003**==

==**NIST IR lifecycle (PICERL)**==

==**CIA Triad (with examples)**==

==**Cyber Kill Chain stages**==

==**Pyramid of Pain concept**==


🔹 Critical Windows Event IDs (Section 3)

Memorize meanings of:

4624

4625

4688

4720

4732

4769

7045

1102

4104

You should instantly respond when interviewer says:
“What is 4625?”

🔹 Common Ports (Section 9)

Memorize:
22, 53, 80, 443, 445, 3389

Very common question:
“What port does RDP use?”

🔬 2️⃣ MUST UNDERSTAND DEEPLY (Concept + Scenario)

These are NOT memorization topics.
These are “explain how” topics.

🔥 A) Windows Detection (Most Important)

You must deeply understand:

How brute force looks in logs

Password spraying difference

Suspicious PowerShell patterns

Admin account creation detection

Log clearing detection

Interview Question:
“If you see 100 failed logins and then one success, what will you do?”

If you only memorize 4625 — you fail.
If you explain triage steps — you pass.

🔥 B) Cloud Logs (VERY HOT IN 2026)

Deep understanding needed:

Impossible travel logic

MFA fatigue behavior

Mailbox rule persistence

OAuth abuse basics

Modern SOC = identity-focused.

If you skip this → you are outdated.

🔥 C) EDR Investigation

You must understand:

Process tree analysis

Parent-child relationship

LOLBins behavior

Why Word → PowerShell is suspicious

What “Isolate Host” actually does

Interview question:
“What would you check in EDR if you receive ransomware alert?”

🔥 D) Attack Scenarios (Section 11)

This is CRITICAL.

You must deeply understand:

Kerberoasting logic

Lateral movement detection

Beaconing detection logic

Data exfiltration patterns

Living off the land abuse

Scenario-based interviews dominate 2026 hiring.

🛠 3️⃣ MUST PRACTICE HANDS-ON

These are practical filters:

🔹 SIEM (Section 5)

You must practice:

Splunk basic queries

KQL aggregation

Threshold filtering

You don't memorize syntax.
You practice it.

🔹 Email Analysis (Section 7)

You must practice:

Header reading

Hash lookup

URL analysis

SPF/DKIM basics

Interviewers LOVE phishing scenarios.

🔹 Threat Intelligence Tools

Know how to use:

VirusTotal

AbuseIPDB

GreyNoise

URLScan.io

ANY.RUN

Hybrid Analysis

You don’t memorize — you know how to use them.
