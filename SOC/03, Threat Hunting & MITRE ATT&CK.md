# Threat Hunting
 Actively looking for hackers hiding in your network BEFORE alerts tell you.



```
Reality: Attackers can hide for 200+ days before detection

Timeline:
Day 1: Attacker gets in (phishing email)
Day 30: Steals passwords
Day 60: Moves to other computers
Day 180: Steals sensitive data
Day 200: FINALLY detected by EDR alert ← Too late!

Goal of Hunting: Find them at Day 5, not Day 200
