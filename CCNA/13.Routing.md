- Routing is the process by which a router determines the best path to forward data packets from a source network to a destination network.
- When a packet arrives at a router, the router looks at the destination IP address and checks its routing table to decide where to send the packet next.
```
PC A (192.168.10.5)  wants to reach  PC B (192.168.20.5)

PC A → Router checks routing table → Finds path → Forwards to PC B
```

## How Does a Router Learn Routes
### 3 Ways
 1. Static Routes
 2. Dynamic Routes
 3. Default Route

#### Static Routes
Administrator manually types the route into the router. You tell the router exactly where to send packets for a specific destination.

example
```
ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.20.2
```

**This means:**

- To reach network 192.168.30.0/24
- Send packets to next-hop 192.168.20.2

**When to use Static Routes:**

- Small networks with few routers
- Stub networks (only one way in/out)
- Backup routes
- When you want full control

#### Dynamic Routes
Routers automatically learn routes from other routers using routing protocols. Routers share information with each other and build their routing tables automatically.

Example Protocols: **RIP, OSPF, EIGRP**

**When to use:**
- Medium to large networks
- Networks that change frequently
- When you need automatic failover

**Advantages:**
- Automatic route discovery
- Adapts to network changes
- Less manual work

#### Default Route
A gateway of last resort - when router doesn't know where to send a packet, it sends it to this default path.

example
```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1
```

**This means:**
- For ANY unknown destination (0.0.0.0/0)
- Send it to 192.168.1.1
- 
**Use Case:**
- Connection to Internet
- Branch office connecting to headquarters
- When you cannot know all possible destinations
